# TESA-uncertainty-talk
Talk on uncertainty for 2018 TESA WebEx series (Introduction to Stock Assessment)

Slides (and style to share with Dan Ricard) for talk on 1st November 2018.

**beamer-hake-assessment.rnw** - our 2018 hake assessment talk to use some of as a template. Won't run here (as model results not here). 

**uncertainty-talk.Rnw** - using hake as a template, simplifying down to give example of making a figure, including images, bullet points and the TOC along the top. 

Looks like these are the beamer defaults, I actually like the moving contents thing along the top (points are clickable)- could move to the bottom.
