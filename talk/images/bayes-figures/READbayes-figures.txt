From tecra13to17/tecra07to13/dal My Documents/rprogs/bayes/ - was going through   
 notes at Dal from Draper (course?).


draper4.r -  Chap 5 (p10) binomial bike example. Trying in non-Bayesian way.
 Calc log likelihood,find MLE, find 95% conf interval using W, likelihood ratio
 statistic (that is chisq with p deg freedom). From B8 Oxford stats notes.
draper4a.r - changing the numbers of bikes and total vehicles, but keeping
 the proportions the same. Gives table (in comments at start) of multiple of
 original data and the 95% conf interval for theta. Also Bayesian with beta 
 prior. I played with the multiple and recorded each tiem the conf interval.
draper4b.r - Doing it the Bayesian way, but have conjugacy so can just write
 down the posterior, which is dbeta(thetavec, 2+s, 6.4+n-s), where 
 dbeta(thetavec, 2, 6.4)is the prior. qbeta(c(0.05,0.95), 2, 6.4) = 
 (0.05, 0.50) = 90% interval

draper4btalk.r - Doing bike example for Durham job talk, to give example of
 Bayes' Theorem in action. Changing the numbers to say "observe 10 vehicles,
 or 100 or 1000".
Saving as .png as follows: (and make all have the same max values)
dt1.png - n = 5, s =2
dt2.png - n=20, s=8
dt3.png - n=100, s=40
